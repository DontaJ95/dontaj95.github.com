<p>I am a paid high school intern attending Mcclymonds High and working at Youth Radio. My job is in the Youth Radio's Mobile Action Lab. We create apps to help the community.We design our apps ourselves, while going though endless hours of rapid ideation and coding development, and creating well organized marketing strategies the get our apps in the community. I honestly wanted to be in the app lab because this could be the start of my career to the a game designer. My ultimate goal is to the help the community that has helped me and been shunned for years because of the economic status of most African Americans.</p>
